#Fritzing New Part Kit

Hello, human being. Are you interested in using Fritzing for a project, and just bumped into the fact that a part you'd like to use does not exist? That happens a lot, it turns out. It also turns out that the templates provided by fritzing.org, while well meaning, are pretty terrible. So I made new ones that are much better.

##What Am I supposed to do with these?
Open up each SVG in Inkscape. Design your part all three ways. Import your modified SVGs into Fritzing to assign pins and stuff like that.

##Features

###Breadboard
- a warm neutral background that mimicks the off-white of a breadboard
- all units set to inches
- a grid named DIP that you can turn on or off
- snapping settings that make lining up with the grid excellent

###Schematic
- all units set to inches (no one explains these things)
- a grid that actually matches the schematic view

###PCB
- see most of the groups in the layers panel
- helper objects for drilling inside of front copper or rear copper
- lots of grids for various package sizes, all named
